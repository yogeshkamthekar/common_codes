Selenium Grid - 
HUB - It is computer which acts as server machine where we can load our tests.  
We need to have selenium standalone jar to be downloaded(example-3.3.1) for the same
execute below command where we have above standalone jar present-
java -jar  selenium-server-standalone-3.3.1.jar-role hub -port 4444
port 4444 is default port 
NODE-similar steps needed to have node setup done and also install selenium standalone jar on that node machine
execute below command where we have above standalone jar present-
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.3.1.jar - role node -port 5555 -hub http://123.456.7.89:4444.
We should be getting option as 'the node is registered to hub and ready to use'
once all setup is done as above , in your test code use remote browser and execute as below -
Webdriver driver;
driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(" http://HUB machine IP Address:Hub Port/wd/hub"),capability);
